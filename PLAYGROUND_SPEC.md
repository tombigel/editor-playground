# Playground Spec

This document captures the current editor and implementation model used by the sticky playground.

## Goal

The playground exists to test:

1. the minimal data model for sticky layout behavior
2. how sticky duration should be represented structurally in the DOM
3. how an editor should expose sticky controls predictably
4. how multiple sticky elements inside one section interact

## Node Model

There are three node families:

- `site`
- `wrapper`
- `leaf`

Wrapper roles:

- `section`
- `header`
- `footer`
- `container`

Leaf roles:

- `text`
- `image`
- `link`
- `button`

## Wrapper Model

All wrappers share the same structural behavior:

- outer wrapper element
- one internal `contentWrapper`
- child positioning relative to that content wrapper
- sticky can apply to the wrapper or the content wrapper

### Role promotion

A wrapper can be promoted or demoted between:

- `section`
- `header`
- `footer`

The wrapper keeps the same id.

If a header or footer already exists, promotion asks whether to demote the current one and replace it.

## Nesting Rules

- `section`, `header`, and `footer` cannot contain another `section`, `header`, or `footer`
- `container` can contain other `container`s indefinitely
- wrappers can contain leaves

This keeps site sections top-level while allowing deep nested layout composition through containers.

## Layout Model

The editor uses a freeform placement model, not a predefined fixed grid.

Children are positioned with:

- `x`
- `y`
- `width`
- `height`

Children can be:

- dragged
- resized
- reparented between sections and containers

## Units

The model is breakpoint-ready, even though the current editor only exposes a base breakpoint.

Supported unit types:

- `x`, `y`: `px`, `%`, `vw`, `vh`
- `width`: unit value or `fit-content`
- `height`: unit value, `auto`, or `aspect-ratio(...)`

Internally, values are stored as parsed data shaped like `CSSUnitValue`, but as plain app data rather than browser Typed OM objects.

## Sticky Model

Sticky can be defined on:

- any leaf
- any wrapper
- any wrapper content wrapper

Sticky properties:

- enabled
- target: `self` or `contentWrapper`
- edge: `top`, `bottom`, or `both`
- offset
- duration

### Current editor controls

- duration slider: `0vh` to `400vh` in `25vh` steps
- offset slider: `0vh` to `100vh`

Defaults:

- edge: `top`
- offset: `0`
- duration: `50vh`

## Spacer Model

Spacers are real structural elements.

### Rules

- For `target = self`, the sticky element lives in a sticky track:
  - element first
  - spacer immediately after it
- For `target = contentWrapper`, a real flow spacer after the content wrapper extends the parent
- Spacer visuals can be shown or hidden in the editor
- Offset is visualized separately from duration

### Multiple sticky items in one section

Multiple sticky spacers can overlap in vertical range.

They do not add together.

The final section height is determined by the spacer whose end is furthest down.

## Preview Model

Sticky preview is CSS-native.

JavaScript is used for:

- dragging
- resizing
- rebuilding editor structure

JavaScript is not used for live sticky movement during scroll.

## Editor UX

Current UX includes:

- full-stage canvas
- floating draggable/collapsible panels
- insert panel
- inspector panel
- debug panel
- drag, resize, and reparenting
- local session persistence in `localStorage`

## Validation Policy

Validation stays in the UI.

Invalid input is not written into the document model.

This applies especially to parsed unit fields.

## Debugging Aids

The playground exposes:

- spacer visuals
- offset visuals
- preview sticky toggle
- show spacers toggle
- sticky computation output
- reset stage action

## Running the Playground

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

For a production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
